        <Section title="Why We Built It">
          <p>
            This Pokemon was created out of love for both frontend development and the Pokemon franchise. It&rsquo;s more than
            a projectâ€”it&rsquo;s a fun way to explore working with APIs, server-side rendering, and performance-focused design
            using <strong>Next.js</strong>. Our goal was to blend beauty, performance, and usability into one app.
